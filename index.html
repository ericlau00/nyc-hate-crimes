                    Out of the 377 religiously-motivated hate crimes committed since the beginning of 2019, almost 90%
                    were anti-Semitic. When factoring in all hate crimes since 2019, anti-Semitic attacks still make up
                    the majority. The high number of attacks against Jews in NYC reflect a national trend over recent
                    decades. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are followed by hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.
                    Most of these crimes were directed at gay men. Transgender people and lesbians were also targeted,
                    but to a lesser extent.

                <p>
                    When broken down by borough, each borough's top category of hate crime is anti-Semitic with the
                    exception of Staten Island. The plurality of hate crimes in Staten Island are anti-black. The size
                    of each circle on the map is based on the total number of hate crimes committed in that borough.

                    Crimes did drop during the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York over the spring and summer of
                    2020. However, they do appear to be on the rise once again. Note the blue spike in the middle of
                    March of 2020, denoting hate crimes committed against Asians. This was without a doubt caused by
                    racism because of COVID-19.
