                    Out of the 377 religiously-motivated hate crimes committed since the beginning of 2019, almost 90%
                    were anti-Semitic. When factoring in all hate crimes since 2019, anti-Semitic attacks still make up
                    the majority. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are followed by hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.
                    Most of these crimes were directed at gay men. Transgender people and lesbians were also targeted,
                    but to a lesser extent.

                <p>
                    When broken down by borough, each borough's top category of hate crime is anti-Semitic with the
                    exception of Staten Island. The plurality of hate crimes in Staten Island are anti-black. The size
                    of each circle on the map is based on the total number of hate crimes committed in that borough.
