                Out of the 377 religiously-motivated hate crimes committed since the beginning of 2019, almost 90% were anti-Semitic. When factoring in all hate crimes since 2019, anti-Semitic attacks still make up the majority. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are followed by hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community. Most of these crimes were directed at gay men. Transgender people and lesbians were also targeted, but to a lesser extent.
